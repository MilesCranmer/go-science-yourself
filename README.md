# Go science yourself
Analyzing data collected on myself to optimize my life.

Making this public so other people can try it on themselves, share ideas.

I have been collecting the following stats on myself
(the data itself is private, for now):

- Food/calories (since sometime in 2014, with a few breaks)
- Code written/git commits (in part since November 12, 2014)
- By-the-second & detailed time allocation (since July 3, 2016)
    - This, in turn, can be used to track other things (e.g., hours spent exercising, ...)
- Words written (since June 8, 2017)
- Caffeine intake (since June 21, 2017)
- Water intake (since June 21, 2017)
